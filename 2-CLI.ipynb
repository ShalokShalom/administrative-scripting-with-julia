    "These are your standard streams. The reason I started with a section on files was so I could get to these babies. They are `IO` objects that every script starts with open, and they automatically close at the end. They aren't \"real\" files, but they give the same interfaces as files (besides `seek`). `stdin` is open for reading and both `stdout` and `stderr` are open for writing.\n",

    "\n",
    "However, the creators of Julia know that this is such a common case that both `readlines` and `eachline` default to using stdin. `eachline()` is identical to `eachline(stdin)`\n",
    "\n",
    "`stdout` is the easy one. You already know how to write to it: the `print` and `println` functions. You can also use `write`, of course, if you need to write binary data.\n",

In the first case, `srcfiles` is a vector of strings. `basename.(srcfiles)` returns an array of the basename of each path in `srcfiles`. It's the same as `[basename(s) for s in srcfiles]`. Each element in this array is then joined with the original `dest` directory for the full path. Because this operation contains nested dot operations, they are all _fused_ into a single loop for greater efficiency.\n",
